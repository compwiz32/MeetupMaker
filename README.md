# MeetupMaker

Do you run a user group that uses Meetup for meetings?

I run a very popular user group and I got tired of copy and pasting a bunch of the same txt over and over again from Meetup to YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit and Facebook.

This module is still being built, but the idea is to have a way to build all the meetup meeting data based on who is the speaker for a meeting and the meeting location. Included is also the ability to add in hashtags for social media and YouTube. As of now, you need to populate the data into Meetup, Facebook, YouTube and others but at least it is saved in a central location with formatting for the various media services.

More to come for this module which is still an early alpha build but works in its current form.
